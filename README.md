# CryptoCurrencies
## Overview
The purpose of this repository was to apply unsupervised machine learning models, specifically the KMeans model, to cryptocurrency data in order to create a report that displays which Crypto-Currencies are currently tradable, and how they can be grouped for investment classification. With the resulting data, Accountable Accountability can create investment portfolios for their clients.

Through data reduction via PCA, the creation of an elbow curve and clustering, KMeans sorted our data into 4 different groups for our report.
